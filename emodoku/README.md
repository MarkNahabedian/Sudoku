# Emodoku: Sudoku Puzzles that use Emoji Instead of Digits

Though Sudoku puzzles use numeric digits for the values in cells, the
only property that's required of the symbols that fill the cells of a
SUdoku is that there be nine such symbols that are distinct from one
another.  These symbols could be digits, letters, kanji or emoticons.
The choice of symbols used could convey a message or artistic
sentiment in the puzzle.

The sudoku/emodoku/server package implements a web service for
designing Sudoku puzzles that can use emoji symbols (or any unicode
character) instead of digits.
